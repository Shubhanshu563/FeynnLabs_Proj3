# Dynamic In-Game Advertising Platform

## Project Overview
This project develops a dynamic in-game advertising platform delivering relevant, non-intrusive ads to players based on player behavior and game genre. The platform leverages machine learning for effective ad targeting, enhancing engagement while preserving a gamer-first experience.

## Key Inferences
- **Market Need**: In-game advertising offers brands a unique way to reach highly engaged audiences. However, traditional ads can disrupt gameplay, leading to frustration and lower engagement. This platform addresses this by seamlessly integrating standalone ads tailored to player preferences.
- **Player & Ad Relevance**: The platform clusters players based on behavior, targeting ads that match their interests without interrupting gameplay, leading to a more immersive experience.
- **Monetization Strategy**: Includes CPM, CPC, and CPA models, along with premium subscriptions for developers and advertisers, ensuring multiple revenue streams.

## Repository Contents

1. **Market.ipynb**: 
   - **Purpose**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the gaming market to identify popular game categories and tags.
   - **Data**: Uses Steam data from Kaggle, initially in JSON format and converted to CSV. Dataset link is provided in the notebook.

2. **Code_Implementation.ipynb**:
   - **Purpose**: Unsupervised machine learning algorithm for player segmentation to improve ad targeting.
   - **Data**: Uses player stats from `hltv_playerStats-complete.csv`, focusing on CS:GO as a prominent game.
